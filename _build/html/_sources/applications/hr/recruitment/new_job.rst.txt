Job positions
=============

In the default :menuselection:`Recruitment` dashboard view, all job positions are shown, regardless
of status. Current published positions with active applicants are shown, as well as job positions
that have been created but have not yet been published.

Each job position is shown in an individual kanban card. If the job position is active and
candidates can apply, then a :guilabel:`Published` banner will appear in the top-right corner of the
card.

View submitted applications by clicking anywhere on a job position card.

Recruitment
~~~~~~~~~~~

All the basic information about the job position is listed under the :guilabel:`Recruitment` tab.

  out prior to their interview.
- :guilabel:`Contract Template`: select a contract template that will be used when offering the job
  to a candidate.

.. _interview:

Create interview form
---------------------

An *Interview Form* is used to determine if a candidate is a good fit for a job position. Interview
forms can be as specific or general as desired, and can take the form of a certification, an exam,
or a general questionnaire. Interview forms are determined by the recruitment team.

All interview forms must be created, there are no pre-configured forms in Odoo. To create an
interview form, start from the recruitment tab of the :guilabel:`Job Position` form. In the
:guilabel:`Interview Form` field, enter a name for the new interview form. As the name is typed,
several options populate beneath the entry, :guilabel:`Create (interview form name)`,
:guilabel:`View all`, and :guilabel:`Create and edit...`. Click :guilabel:`Create and edit...`. and
a :guilabel:`Create Interview Form` pop-up window appears.

.. note::
   The option :guilabel:`View all` only appears if there are any interview forms already created.
   If no interview forms exist, the only options available are :guilabel:`Create (interview form
   name)`, and :guilabel:`Create and edit...`.

First, enter a name for the form in the :guilabel:`Name` field. This should be indicative of when
the form should be used. For example, is the form specific to a job position, or is it a general
form that can be used for all recruitment scenarios?

Next, select what kind of interview form is being created. The default is :guilabel:`Custom`, which
is pre-selected. The various options are :guilabel:`Survey`, :guilabel:`Live session`,
:guilabel:`Assessment`, :guilabel:`Custom`, and :guilabel:`Appraisal`.

Then select the person responsible for the form from the drop-down menu for the
:guilabel:`Responsible` field.

If desired, an image can be added to the interview form. Mouse over the camera icon on the far right
and a :guilabel:`‚úèÔ∏è (pencil)` icon appears. Click the :guilabel:`‚úèÔ∏è (pencil)` icon and a file
explorer window appears. Navigate to the desired image file, then click :guilabel:`Open` to select
it.

Questions
~~~~~~~~~

In the :guilabel:`Questions` tab, click on :guilabel:`Add a section` to add a section to the form. A
line appears, and a section heading can be entered. When complete, click off the line, or press
enter to lock in the new section on the form.

Next, click :guilabel:`Add a question` to add a question to the section. A :guilabel:`Create
Sections and Questions` pop-up window appears where the question details are entered. Type out the
question in the top line.

There are several :guilabel:`Question Types` to choose from:

- :guilabel:`Multiple choice: only one answer`: a multiple choice question that only allows the
  candidate to select one answer
- :guilabel:`Multiple choice: multiple answers allowed`: a multiple choice question that allows the
  candidate to select multiple answers
- :guilabel:`Multiple Lines Text Box`: allows the applicant to enter several lines of text
- :guilabel:`Single Line Text Box`: limits the applicant to only a single line of text
- :guilabel:`Numerical Value`: only allows a number to be entered
- :guilabel:`Date`: a calendar module is presented to select a date
- :guilabel:`Datetime`: a calendar module and a clock icon is presented to select a date and time
- :guilabel:`Matrix`: a customizable table that allows the candidate to choose an answer for each
  row

After selecting a question type, a sample question appears in gray. This represents how the question
will be displayed to applicants.

Answers
*******

If :guilabel:`Multiple choice: only one answer`, :guilabel:`Multiple choice: multiple answers
allowed`, :guilabel:`Single Line Text Box`, or :guilabel:`Matrix` is selected for the
:guilabel:`Question Type`, an :guilabel:`Answers` tab appears beneath the question. If another
question type is selected, the :guilabel:`Answers` tab remains hidden from view.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Multiple choice

      For both the :guilabel:`Multiple choice: only one answer` and :guilabel:`Multiple choice:
      multiple answers allowed` question type, the answers are populated in the same way.

      First, in the :guilabel:`Answers` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a line`. A line appears, and an
      answer can be entered. After typing in the answer, click off the line, or press enter to lock
      in the new answer on the form and have another answer line appear.

      If desired, an image can be attached to the answer. Click on a line to select it, and an
      :guilabel:`Upload your file` button appears on the right side. Click the :guilabel:`Upload
      your file` button and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to the image file, select it,
      then click :guilabel:`Open` to select it.

      Repeat this for all the answers to be added for the multiple choice question. The answers can
      be rearranged in any order. To move an answer, click on the six small squares on the far left
      of each answer line, and drag the answer to the desired position. The order the answers appear
      in the form is the order the answers will appear online.

      To delete a line, click on the :guilabel:`üóëÔ∏è (trash can)` icon on the far right side of the
      answer line.

   .. tab:: Single Line Text Box

      If the :guilabel:`Single Line Text Box` question type is selected, only two checkboxes appear
      in the :guilabel:`Answers` tab:

      - :guilabel:`Input must be an email`: activate this option if the answer must be in the format
        of an email address.

        - :guilabel:`Save as user email?`: this option appears if :guilabel:`Input must be an email`
          is selected. This saves the email entered on the form as the user's email, and will be
          used anytime Odoo contacts the user via email.

      - :guilabel:`Save as user nickname?`: activate this option to populate the answer as the
        user's nickname. This is stored and used anywhere Odoo uses a nickname.

         :align: center
         :alt: The three possible checkboxes that can appear if a single line of text is selected
               for the question type.

   .. tab:: Matrix

      Sometimes, a question is asked that does not fit a standard answer format, and is best suited
      for a matrix. For example, asking an applicant what is their availability to work compared to
      the various shifts is a perfect question for a matrix format. In this example, an applicant
      can click on all the shifts they are available to work.

      For a :guilabel:`Matrix` question type, there are two sets of data that need to be input. The
      rows and columns must both be configured. The columns are represented by the
      :guilabel:`Choices` section, while the rows are configured in the :guilabel:`Rows` section.

      The method for populating both sections is the same. In the :guilabel:`Answers` tab, click
      :guilabel:`Add a line` in either the :guilabel:`Choices` or :guilabel:`Row` section.  A line
      appears, and an answer can be entered. After typing in the answer, click off the line, or
      press enter to lock in the new answer on the form and have another answer line appear. Repeat
      this for all answers for both the :guilabel:`Choices` and :guilabel:`Rows` sections.

      .. figure:: new_job/matrix.png
         :align: center

         This is an example matrix that asks an applicant what shifts they are available to work on
         Saturdays and Sundays, either morning, afternoon, or evening.

:guilabel:`Mandatory Answer`. An :guilabel:`Error message` field appears, with some example text in
gray (*This question requires an answer*). Enter the message that should appear if the applicant
attempts to move on to the next question without answering this required one. The text should
explain that the question must be answered.

Layout
^^^^^^

If the question should only appear if a previous question is answered in a specific way, activate
the :guilabel:`Conditional Display` option. A new :guilabel:`Triggering Question` field appears.
Using the drop-down menu, select the previous question this new question is linked to. Once a
previous question is selected, a :guilabel:`Triggering Answer` field appears. Select the answer that
must be selected in order for the new question to appear.

.. example::
   To further illustrate a triggering question, the following is an example that is applicable to
   recruitment. The question, `Do you have experience with managing a sales team?` is already
   added. A new question is then added, `How many years of experience?`. This question should *only*
   appear if the applicant selected `Yes` to the question `Do you have prior experience managing a
   sales team?`.

   To properly configure this example, activate the :guilabel:`Conditional Display` option. Then,
   select `Do you have experience with managing a sales team?` as the :guilabel:`Triggering
   Question`. Then, select :guilabel:`Yes` for the triggering answer.
