Packaging
=========

In Odoo *Inventory*, *packaging* refers to disposable containers holding multiple units of a
specific product. Each specific packaging **must** be defined on the individual product form.

For example, different packages for cans of soda, such as a 6-pack, a 12-pack, or a case of 36, need
to be configured on the individual product form. This is because packagings are product specific â€”
**not** generic.

Configuration
=============

To use packagings, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`. Then,
under the :guilabel:`Products` heading, enable the :guilabel:`Product Packagings` feature, and click
:guilabel:`Save`.

Create packaging
================

Packagings can be created directly on the product form, or from the :guilabel:`Product Packagings`
page.

From product form
-----------------

Create packagings on a product form by going to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Products -->
Products`, and select the desired product.

Under the :guilabel:`Inventory` tab, scroll down to the :guilabel:`Packaging` section, and click
:guilabel:`Add a line`. In the table, fill out the following fields:

- :guilabel:`Packaging` (required): name of packaging that appears on sales/purchase orders as a
  packaging option for the product.
- :guilabel:`Contained quantity` (required): amount of product in the packaging.
- :guilabel:`Unit of Measure` (required): measurement unit for quantifying the product.
- :guilabel:`Sales`: check this option for packagings intended for use on sales orders.
- :guilabel:`Purchase`: check this option for packagings intended for use on purchase orders.

.. note::
   Access additional fields in the :guilabel:`Packaging` table below by clicking the
   :guilabel:`(sliders)` icon to the far-right of the column titles in the :guilabel:`Packaging`
   section, and selecting the desired options from the drop-down menu that appears.

- :guilabel:`Barcode`: identifier for tracing packaging in stock moves or pickings, using the
  :ref:`Barcode app <barcode/operations/intro>`. Leave blank if not in use.
- :guilabel:`Company`: indicates the packaging is only available at the selected company. Leave
  blank to make the packaging available across all companies.

.. example::
   To create a packaging type for six units of the product, `Grape Soda`, begin by clicking
   :guilabel:`Add a line`. In the line, name the :guilabel:`Packaging` `6-pack`, and set the
   :guilabel:`Contained quantity` to `6`. Repeat this process for additional packagings.

From product packagings page
----------------------------

To view all packagings that have been created, go to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Product Packagings`. Doing so reveals the :guilabel:`Product Packagings` page with a complete
list of all packagings that have been created for all products. Create new packagings by clicking
:guilabel:`New`.

.. example::
   Two soda products, `Grape Soda` and `Diet Coke`, have three types of packagings configured. On
   the :guilabel:`Product Packagings` page, each product can be sold as a `6-Pack` that contains 6
   products, as a `12-Pack` of 12 products, or as a `Case` of 32 products.

Apply packagings
================

When creating a sales order in the :menuselection:`Sales` app, specify the packagings that should be
used for the product. The chosen packaging is displayed on the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` under the
:guilabel:`Packaging` field.

.. example::
   18 cans of the product, `Grape Soda`, is packed using three 6-pack packagings.

.. tip::
   Packaging can be used in conjunction with Odoo :ref:`Barcode <inventory/barcode/software>`. When
   receiving products from suppliers, scanning the packaging barcode automatically adds the number
   of units in the packaging to the internal count of the product.
